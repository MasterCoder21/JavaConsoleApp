# JavaConsoleApp
---
#### An easy to use, extremely user-customizable extension to the Microsoft Command Line written in Java.
### Features:
 - Console configuration directly accessible from the command line
 - Ability to load user-made plugins which can add commands and other functionality to the command line
 - Rewrites of standard Microsoft Command Line commands to improve efficiency
 - Universal Windows Executable (work in progress) - Don't worry about not having Java installed!

### WIP:
 - "Window & menu" support (kind of like Python's curses library)
 - Custom console window instead of default Windows command line
